# wordshell

## NOTE: This wordshell now uses a local copy of the controller file and doesn't pull it in from remote storage

### mikeybeck's mods:
- 05/16: Addition of --no-maintenance mode, which prevents site from going into maintenance mode when updating plugins.  (not recommended but y'know...)
- 06/16: Made remote controller local only so I can make changes (no longer fetches from Amazon s3)
- 06/17: Added numerical index to plugin list to make selection/specification easier (display is a bit buggy but selection should work ok)
